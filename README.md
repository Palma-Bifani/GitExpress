## **Git flow**

Learn the fundamental concepts and commands of git version control, from initialization to collaboration and solving conflicts.

## Applications

### **Python packages**

Apply Git version control to Python projects. Please check the links if you want to release a Python package through PyPI (`pip install`). 

> [Code/Astro](https://github.com/semaphoreP/codeastro/tree/main)

Applications for [Code/Astro 2024](https://semaphorep.github.io/codeastro/) are open! Don't miss this opportunity. I sincerely recommend attending in person, but if not possible, you can always follow the content of the repository to release a python package.

> [Science and Commit](https://github.com/Science-and-Commit/Workshop_2022)

Science and Commit is my version of Code/Astro, adapted for Spanish-speaking students during the pandemic in Chile.


### **Personal webpage**

You can integrate git into web development projects and create a personal webpage with GitHub Pages.
