## **Git flow**

Here, you will learn the fundamental concepts and commands of git version control, from initialization to collaboration and conflict resolution.


*** 

## Useful applications

### **Python packages**

Apply git version control to Python projects. Please check the links if you want to release a Python package through PyPI (`pip install`). 

- [Code/Astro](https://github.com/semaphoreP/codeastro/tree/main)

Applications for [Code/Astro 2024](https://semaphorep.github.io/codeastro/) are open! Don't miss this opportunity. I think it's best for you to attend in person, but you can follow the repository's content too.

- [Science and Commit](https://github.com/Science-and-Commit/Workshop_2022)

Science and Commit is an adapted version of Code/Astro done by myself together with Paula Cáceres, Rafael Martínez, and José Vines, aiming to increase the collaboration among Spanish-speaking students during the pandemic in Chile.


### **Personal webpage**

You can integrate git into web development projects and create a personal webpage with GitHub Pages.

- Quickstart for GitHub Pages [here.](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)

Examples:
- [https://science-and-commit.github.io](https://science-and-commit.github.io)
- [https://semaphorep.github.io/codeastro/](https://semaphorep.github.io/codeastro/)
