- Create a file called `README.md` and write something in it.
- Follow the gitflow: `git status` + `git add *` + `git commit -m "message"`
- Create a new branch, add a new file, and commit.
- Remerge your branch and delete it. 
- Make an additional modification and commit.
- Travel back a commit, create a new branch from here and edit the same file you modified in the previous step.
